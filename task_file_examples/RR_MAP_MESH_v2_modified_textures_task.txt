# by default _v2 version of this task uses textures inbuilt into the IWTE.exe which resemble the style of the vanilla RR map
# _v2 adds small models to the map_heights generated mesh in areas where hill or mountains_high ground types occur on 'odd,odd' pixels, this is intended to give a result resembling the vanilla map
# the _v2 task can be expanded to amend where the default textures are used and/or to introduce your own textures
# IWTE will use texconv.exe to convert the texture tga files produced to dds ready for use in the game, the texconv.exe needs to be in the same folder as the IWTE.exe for this to work
