# used to create a CSV file of the textures the cas files say they are using
# CSV files can be opened in Excel or other spreadsheet programs
# RTW and M2 will crash if the tga files specified inside cas models are not supplied
# texture.tga location is normally relative to the .cas file, e.g. in /textures folder below the .cas location
# if you have the .cas file in the mod-folder you also need its specified tga in the mod-folder regardless of whether it exists in vanilla/data 
# RR generally does not crash if tga files are missing but will display the object in bright pink instead
