# You will need to have opened the three binary files, .world .worldcollision and .animinstances before running this task
# Shading adds darker colour at vertexes 'shaded' by overhangs or other objects
# Lighting applies when a light emitting effect is activated nearby
# If building elements are set to apply lighting from an effect which has been removed you may get odd results including 'disco' lighting if fewer effects exist than are indexed
# You should therefore reset the lighting after changing effects or if pasting in building mesh elements from other settlements
