# This will replace the CONTENTS of the settlement with the objects in the 3D file
# The names of the meshes in the 3D file must correspond to valid dbb entries
# Walls, streetplan and floor are ignored - walls will remain as listed in the original settlement plan 
# The revised settlement name will have the suffix _new0* added to the name to avoid accidental overwriting
