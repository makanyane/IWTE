# This process allows you to swap the names of bones around within all cas files in a subdirectory. This is because some bone names are hard coded and must be present for certain unit types
# however you may be trying to swap or hide certain things.
# The new named bone must not already exist. Example below swaps bone_Lhand and bone_Rhand
# This function will work for full .cas animation files (as supplied by Caliban, or as extracted from packs by IWTE) - it will NOT work on .cas anim files 'unpacked' by XIDX or Toolbox
# This function will also work for bone names within .cas models, e.g. M2 strat, or RTW units.
