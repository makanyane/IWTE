# takes 4 adjacent 2048 textures and combines them into 1 4096 texture - helps with the bug caused by total number of textures
# input textures can be in .dds format - if the TexConv.exe is present the new textures will be generated as dds
# IWTE will produce a descr_map_tiles.txt file to be used with the resultant texture/piece combinations
