# To read an RR settlement plan and allow editing either in IWTE 2D window or in 3D program with .dae or .glb
# If editing in Blender move items in OBJECT MODE (not edit), and do not apply transforms - the moved to/rotated to information is needed to populate the settlement_plan info
# Wall position changes will not be picked up from 3D programs, they can only be made in the IWTE 2D window which will restrict movements to valid grid positions
# IWTE does not sanity check the wall perimeter for completeness, please ensure you do not leave gaps/overlaps
# An extract_to_settlement_plan will be created for you to load your 3D file info back into the plan
# The .dae or .glb files if requested will be written to "anyoutfiles" folder below the input settlement plan location e.g. D:\RRMods\My Mods\mod_name\data\settlement_plans\anyoutfiles
