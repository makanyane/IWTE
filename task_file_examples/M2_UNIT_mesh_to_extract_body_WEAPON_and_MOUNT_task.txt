# This uses the same layout as a standard mesh_to_dae but includes a mount and rider with one weapon (weapon and shield can also be used)
# Please note the mount specific details at the bottom of the file. A returned extract_to_mesh task file will also be generated. 
# The return task file will have extra numbers after the names of the animation cas files. 
# They are specifically start and end frames for the rider anims then start and end frames for the mount (the start frames are always aligned to the longest of the animations where mount and rider anims differ)
# If you're using this to form a combined anim for video
