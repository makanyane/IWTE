# used to create a CSV file of cas files used for building collisions in RR/RTW .
# use the csv file in Excel or similar spreadsheet program to view and check that mesh names are correct, e.g. starting collision, collision3d or collision_3d
# filter to check that all meshes starting collision are flat, e.g. diff Y column should = 0
