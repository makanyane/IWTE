# Example of a created readback task file created from cas_to_extract_with_multiple_anims_task.txt
# Please note the <overlap_frames> and <frames_in> are commented out as they aren't used in the read back.
# The values after the cas files are the start (0 frame) and the last frame of the cas files used to create the original dae file.
# For the read back these values are used to determine the start and end frames for each of the cas files ie they will split the files up at that point.
# Any files not required simply comment out with a # at the start. Repeat names will overwrite.
# This is quite powerful as a tool as you can change the cas mesh model and a batch of cas animations in one hit or in whatever variations of this you want to use.
