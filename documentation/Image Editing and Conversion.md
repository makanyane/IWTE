## M2 Terrain Mask Editing

Terrain mask editing is a special case of image editing.  You are required to load the settlement's .worldterrain file before loading the mask so the mask image can be stretched to the size it will appear in game.  You can then optionally also load the settlements 3 binary files and view the settlement outline relative to the mask.
