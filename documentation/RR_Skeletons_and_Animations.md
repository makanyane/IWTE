# Rome Remastered Skeletons and Animations

The Rome Remastered skeletons and animations are broadly similar to the OG RTW ones. Differences include:
* Voice/sound bank changes inside skeletons
* Different pack version number
* 2 additional anims per skeleton
* Additional anims added via descr_skeleton_feral_overrides.txt and not packed
* Scaling process is different - RR has scale modified at skeleton level only - duplicate anims per scaled variant aren't required

Some of these changes make it impractical to use the same tools as for RTW skeletons, so you can either use IWTE and work with the RR format, or work with the old RTW format/files and convert using Feral's [Skeleton Converter](https://github.com/FeralInteractive/romeremastered/blob/main/tools/SkeletonConverter/SkeletonConverter.md).
