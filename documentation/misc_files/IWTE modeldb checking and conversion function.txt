IWTE modeldb function
This is top line menu => Modelfiles => Modeldb => modeldb to csv

This produces a subdirectory to the one that the *.modeldb is in called  from_modeldb

In this subdirectory it generates :
*_models.txt                        This file contains a line by line description of what it read, what it was suppose to be, and a binary position in the file.
*_models_errors.txt                 This file contains any errors detected with a description of the error and a position (same as in the file above)
*_models_unit_faction_data.csv      File containing the modeldb faction data 
*_models_unit_lod_data.csv          File containing the modeldb lod data 
*_models_unit_skeleton_data.csv     File containing the modeldb skeleton data 
*_models_new.modeldb                reformatted file BUT not corrected for all errors

you can make corrections in the csv files or the original modeldb files.
The reformatting file puts the line breaks in postions which are more 'correct' in terms of the structure and it also alphabetically sorts by model unit.


eg 
_Models.txt

special note
------------------
If your modeldb starts with something like this (ie that second line is for a unit called blank then IWTE will remove that record if it passes the standard checks).
ie it will not get added into the CSV file and will not be added into a new modeldb generated by IWTE.


22 serialization::archive 3 0 0 0 0 1230 0 0
5 blank 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Basically IWTE tries to check the mount types for recreating a modeldb (valid ones are 'none', 'horse', 'elephant', 'camel') and this record indicates it has a mount but has no mount type name which is invalid. 
The record contains the extra pads (groups of 0 0 ) which are needed in the first record and IWTE reorders the file and doesn't need to know. MTW2 does need the first
record to be padded correctly so please beware. This passes the formatting check but would be invalid and cause a crash if ever called (AFAIK).
