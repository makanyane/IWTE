## M2 specific elements

M2TW has the ability to regenerate the geography db file from the text file however this process wipes out all the distance colour values and can also cause memory problems as ALL the battlemap textures are read and held in memory.

The M2TW geography db has settable options for the density of the individual vegetation types per battlemap ground-type.
