# Generating text representations of binary files with IWTE

A wide variety of IWTE tasks will let you add the tag

<create_text_file>                     yes  
or  
<create_text_file>                     full 

The yes option will generate a text file containing a summary of the data in the binary file but exclude long sections such as vertex positions or uvs.

The full option will generate a text file containing all the data in the binary file with additional comments and notes of the position in the file.

These options can be used by anyone wishing to understand more about the Total War base files, perhaps to develop their own tools or for research into modding possibilities.

Some example text files are included in the same folder as this .md
