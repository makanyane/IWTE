# M2TW .worldpathfinding file

Most .worlds in M2TW battlemaps uses a .worldpathfinding file, the file controls where troops can walk/stand.  Most techtree buildings do not have a .worldpathfinding file assigned, but they can have them added.

The .worldpathfinding for settlements includes blocked areas under walls and gates, these objects need to have 'breaches' assigned so that troops can cross them when the wall is destroyed or the gate opened.

If you edit a .worldpathfinding file in IWTE's 2d window you can load and view the .world file structures at the same time to easily tell which areas need to be blocked.
